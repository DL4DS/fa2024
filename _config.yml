# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.github_repo }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
# For more information, see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/

course_name: Deep Learning for Data Science (DL4DS)
course_description: "In this course we will dive into Deep Learning. We'll balance important theoretical concepts with hands on network training and applications using modern deep learning python frameworks. We'll explore numerous network architectures like CNNs, transformers, and the rapidly developing state-of-the-art of large pre-trained foundation models. You'll have the chance to apply what you've learned in a final project."
